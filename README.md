The goal of this project was to see if stocks actually correlate regarding to their price movement.(Experience at the time:1 month of coding in python)

I looked at two differenet types of stock pairs, one that has two stocks that are part of the same industry 
and the second pair was based on two companies that do business with each other to see if one companies price movement
could dictate the price movement of the other.
