Hypothesis:
-
What is the correlation if any between stocks that are in the same sector or stocks that do business with each other?

Thought process:
-
From my experience with trading and stocks, it seemed that there was a visual correlation between stock price movement regards those that within the same sector or stocks that do business with each other.  The visual analysis was not good enough for most types of analysis and this is no exception, but I wanted to see if there was even a visual correlation on a yearly basis that would give the slightest suggestion of correlation between movements between the years of 2007-2017. Then I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the largest price movements of the stocks per year.  From there I did the following analysis isolated by year, correlation coefficients, regression analysis, histograms and box plots.

Data set:
-
I utilized day data, focusing on the adjusted close, from Quandl for the  stocks pairs of Microsoft and Apple as well as Nvidia and Amazon.
